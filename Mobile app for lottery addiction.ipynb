    "We will contribute to the development of a mobile app by building a couple of functions that are mostly focused on calculating probabilities in this project. By assisting consumers in properly estimating their chances of winning, the software aims to both prevent and treat lottery addiction.\n",

    "\n",
    "The concept for the app came from a medical center that specializes in treating gambling addictions. The institute already has a team of developers who will build the app, but we'll be responsible for the logical core and probability calculations. They want us to focus on the 6/49 lottery for the first version of the app and design functionalities that can answer the following questions for users:\n",
    "\n",
    "How likely is it that a single ticket will win the grand prize?\n",
    "What are the chances of winning the grand prize if we buy 40 tickets (or any other number)?\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the likelihood of a single ticket containing at least five (or four, or three) winning numbers?\n",
    "\n",
    "The scenario we'll be following for the duration of this project is hypothetical; the goal is to practice using probability and combinatorics (permutations and combinations) principles in a context that mimics a real-world situation.\n"

    "For the first version of the app, we coded four main functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- one_ticket_probability() — calculates the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket\n",
    "- check_historical_occurrence() — checks whether a certain combination has occurred in the Canada lottery data set\n",
    "- multi_ticket_probability() — calculates the probability for any number of of tickets between 1 and 13,983,816\n",
    "- probability_less_6() — calculates the probability of having two, three, four or five winning numbers exactly\n",
    "Possible features for a second version of the app include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Making the outputs even easier to understand by adding fun analogies (for example, we can find probabilities for strange events and compare with the chances of winning in lottery; for instance, we can output something along the lines \"You are 100 times more likely to be the victim of a shark attack than winning the lottery\")\n",
    "- Combining the one_ticket_probability() and check_historical_occurrence() to output information on probability and historical occurrence at the same time\n",
    "- Create a function similar to probability_less_6() which calculates the probability of having at least two, three, four or five winning numbers. Hint: the number of successful outcomes for having at least four winning numbers is the sum of these three numbers:\n",
